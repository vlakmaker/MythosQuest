**Date:** 2025-03-28  
**Milestone:** MVP with Login & Streaming Support  
**Author:** vlakmaker

## 🎯 What We Did

Today we built and tested a **functional login system** for MythosQuest and resolved a **streaming issue** caused by improperly handled frontend updates.

### 🧱 Features Added
- Secure **user registration** and **login** using hashed passwords
- **Session-based access control** (only logged-in users can play)
- **Logout route** to clear sessions
- AI streaming now **yields full readable chunks**, not individual letters
- Fixed JavaScript front-end to **append stream chunks correctly**

---

## 🐛 Issues Faced

### ❌ Login Bug (tuple indexing)
- `get_user()` returned a tuple, and accessing with `user["password"]` caused a `TypeError`.
- ✅ **Fix:** Accessed hashed password using `user[2]`.

### ❌ Streaming Repetition
- The frontend JavaScript was **replacing** the full response with each chunk.
- ✅ **Fix:** Used `+=` and `TextDecoder` with `response.body.getReader()` for proper appending.

### ❌ Unprotected Routes
- The main page `/` was accessible without login.
- ✅ **Fix:** Added `if "user" not in session: redirect(url_for("login"))`

## 🚀 MVP Achieved
MythosQuest is now playable with:
- User login
- Secure backend
- Functional streaming via CosmosRP API

## ✅ Next Steps
- Break large `ai_dm.py` into blueprints/modules
- Allow AI memory per user session
- Add UI polish and start persistent world state
- Explore simple admin panel

## 💡 Reflection
It felt amazing to build something that works from end to end — a proper login system, private access, and the core AI experience is alive! Streaming isn't silky-smooth yet, but it's working, and it's **fun to play**.
