- **Frontend Streaming Polishing Started**
  - Improved the display of streamed AI responses to follow JanitorAI/CosmosRP-style formatting.
  - Implemented `renderFormattedResponse()` with:
    - Text sanitization (HTML-safe output)
    - `*action*` ‚Üí `<em>` italics conversion
    - Paragraph and single newline handling
    - Full re-rendering of accumulated streamed text
  - Ensured proper formatting for immersive TTRPG roleplay in real-time.

- **Format Refinement and Compatibility Testing**
  - Tested with both CosmosRP and OpenRouter:
    - Cosmos outputs: well-formatted, immersive flow.
    - OpenRouter outputs: required extra cleanup due to frequent token breaks (e.g., `King:That`).
  - Polished the regex and newline logic:
    - Improved speaker bolding (`King:`, `Grand Vizier:`).
    - Fine-tuned newline/space replacement based on chunk quality.
  - Verified MVP-level experience is now stable for conversations.
  - Agreed to postpone modularization or extra formatting logic for descriptive-only replies.
