### âœ… Current Logic Breakdown

### 1. **Environment Setup + API Configuration**

- Loads environment variables from `.env` using `dotenv`.
- Retrieves:
    - `COSMOSRP_API_KEY`
    - `COSMOSRP_API_URL`
- Basic validation: throws/logs an error if the API key is missing.
- Sets up logging for debugging.

ðŸ’¡ *Good callout on this. You could consider moving all config-related logic into a `config.py` later for cleanliness.*

---

### 2. **Initialize Flask App**

- Creates the Flask app instance.
- Sets `secret_key` from `.env` for session support.
- Initializes logging again (already done earlier â€” can be centralized).

ðŸ’¡ *Eventually we may want to move session and user config into an `auth.py` or `extensions.py`.*

### 3. **Flask Routes**

| Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Homepage (protected, redirects to login) |
| `/generate` | Handles POST prompts and streams AI output |
| `/register` | New user registration with form |
| `/login` | Basic login with session storage |
| `/logout` | Ends session and redirects to login |

ðŸ§  *Youâ€™re right â€” these are the core of the user flow.*

### 4. **CosmosRP AI Streaming**

- `stream_response(prompt)`:
    - Sends a POST to the CosmosRP API using `requests`.
    - Streams the response back chunk-by-chunk.
    - Checks for proper SSE format (`data:`), buffers output until a sentence ends.
    - Handles `[DONE]` tokens.

âœ… This logic works and has been tested â€” though we may want to eventually move this logic to its own module (`ai_engine.py`) for readability.

### 5. **Main App Start**

- Uses:
    
    ```python
    python
    CopyEdit
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000, debug=True)
    
    ```
    
- Basic Flask run config for local use.

### ðŸ§¼ Suggestions for Next Refactor Phase

Now that the code works and you're planning to make it cleaner:

Task	Why It Matters
Refactor into modules	Split routes, auth, and ai into their own files.
Centralize config	Move .env reading and API constants to a config file.
Clarify app logic flow	Comment or diagram the sequence of logic from login to game generation.
Audit imports and cleanup	Remove unused imports or duplicated logging calls.
