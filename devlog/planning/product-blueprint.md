# 🧠 MythosQuest – Product Thinking Blueprint

## 1. 🧭 Vision & Purpose

**Why does MythosQuest exist?**

I initially wanted to see how difficult it would be to run an AI locally. In order to do so, Bitty and I came up with the idea to create a historically accurate dungeon master as this project would be ambitious enough to keep learning a lot. 

- What is the deeper motivation behind creating it?

I want a project that is really something I build on my own and learn a lot. I am an avid online roleplayer, using tools like [Janitor.ai](http://Janitor.ai) and even though I love talking to my character and develop a world and story line that I like. In the end, I am the one driving the narrative and sometimes this becomes a little bit difficult as I don’t know how the story needs to progress. So then the chat becomes kind of a slice of life story with little storylines based on feel of the moment of writing. Some people don’t know how to start their own world. So I like to create a more guided experience with the agency of the user itself

- What kind of impact do you want it to have (on users, on the world, on yourself)?

In contrast to other Dungeon AI tools out there. I want to focus on historical scenario’s in which a player can set up a character in time and space. Interact with characters and have a AI guided experience while learning something about historical era they play in. An inspiration for the game could be Ambition a minuet in power

## 2. 🎯 Problem Space

**What problem(s) are you solving?**

- For yourself?

Having the joy of being in a roleplay that I find interesting without always having to think about the story and just enjoy the ride. 

- For roleplayers/writers/historians?

An unique experience where the player can learn something about the historical era and feel immersed in a guided counterfactual history. In this case I’d like to have the user an similar experience when they write historical fiction for Europa Universalis IV for example. 

- For casual vs dedicated users?

I do think the first version will be for casual players who like to have a guided story. Dedicated users may find being boxed in constricting and rather just talk to a character.

## 3. 🌍 User Archetypes

**Who is MythosQuest for?**

- List at least 3 types of users who would be excited to use this (e.g., the solo writer, the worldbuilder, the history student).
- Casual game enthousiast: someone who is not familiar with online roleplaying and find the idea to talk to a random character weird. They want to take their first step and have a guided experience instead.
- Historical enthousiast: Someone who loves exploring history, maybe already writes fanfiction, but want to create a story set in a particular era, learn from it. Enjoy the experience and maybe use MythosQuest as an inspiration for their own story.
- Solo writer: Someone who wants to experiment with a setting and see a guided version of their historical idea before writing it themselves.

## 4. 💡 Unique Value Proposition

**What makes MythosQuest stand out?**

- What is *different* about MythosQuest compared to apps like JanitorAI, AI Dungeon, etc.?

Having a guided, historical experience that sits in between chatting to a character and telling your own story through conversation and a traditional D&D of experience. Here we want to focus on the narrative roleplay element and less focus combat, but still work with some kind of randomizer for different actions. Build skills and have cause and effect.  

- What kind of experience does it offer that others don’t?

An immersive historical guided roleplay experience

## 5. 🕹️ Core Experience

**What should the user feel while using MythosQuest?**

- Immersion? Control? Discovery? Challenge?

The user should feel immersed, feeling like they only have control over their own character. That skill based actions have consequences. That thew user can learn from a scenario, discover the world and enjoy the experience. 

- What emotions or vibes are central to the app's identity?

It should pique interest to learn more about history, but above all it should be a chill guided experience
