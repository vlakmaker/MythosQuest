### ✅ Devlog – Refactor Milestone Complete (2025-04-15)

Today marks the successful completion of the full **MythosQuest app refactor**. The project has evolved from a monolithic test script into a structured, modular, and production-ready Flask web application with clean routing, user login, AI streaming, and a clear architecture.

### 🔧 Key Refactor Highlights

- ✅ **Reorganized Project Structure**:
    - Split app into `/app/`, `/routes/`, `/templates/`, and `/static/`
    - Introduced Blueprints for clean route separation (`auth_bp`, `game_bp`)
    - `run.py` serves as the proper entry point
- ✅ **Modular Logic**:
    - `config.py` handles environment setup and API configs
    - `ai.py` (formerly `app.py`) now streams CosmosRP responses safely
    - `models.py` moved and cleaned for SQLite-based user management
    - Separated `auth_routes.py` and `game_routes.py` for clarity
- ✅ **Error Handling + Logging**:
    - Fixed dozens of JSON decode errors via buffered parsing
    - Added defensive streaming for empty lines
    - Cleaned up `url_for()` route usage across templates
- ✅ **Frontend Templates**:
    - Updated `login.html`, `register.html`, and `index.html` for correct route prefixes (`auth.register`, `auth.login`)
    - Verified streaming output displays without crashing
- ✅ **Legacy Cleanup**:
    - Archived deprecated files (e.g., `ai_dm.py`, `memory_manager.py`, `memory.db`, `models.py`)
    - Removed Windows drag metadata files
    - Prepared for version-controlled commits via new feature branch
